The Panzerkampfwagen series began in the 1930s with Germany creating the Panzer I or Sd. Kfz. 101 or "Special Purpose Vehicle". Specifically the design of the Panzer I began in 1932 and its production entered in 1934. However, Germany wasn't satisfied with this vehicle as they had bigger plans for military tanks ever since its introduction in the First World War, or the "Great War", by Great Britain.
